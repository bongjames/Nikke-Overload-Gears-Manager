## What it does

Nikke Manager gives you a full picture of your roster's investment gaps and helps you prioritise where to spend limited resources. At its core is an overload gear tracker: enter the stat lines rolled on a piece, and the app tells you whether to keep it, lock a line and reroll the rest, or reset entirely — with estimated Overload Rock costs based on actual probability math. Beyond gear, the Overview dashboard surfaces skill levels, Collection Dolls, bond, and cube levels that are below recommendations, so you always know what to work on next.

| **Weights**         | Customise how much each stat is worth in the scoring formula                                                                                       |

### Overview sub-views

| Sub-view            | What it shows                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rock Efficiency** | Ranks all your Nikkes' gear slots by %gain per rock — see where rocks have the most impact, optionally weighted by Solo Raid damage |
| **Equipment**       | Lists overload gear lines below Prydwen recommendations, sorted by OL priority                                                      |
| **Skills**          | Lists skill levels below recommended, sorted by skill priority and bossing tier                                                     |
| **Dolls**           | Shows which high-bossing Nikkes (tier S+) still need their recommended Collection Doll                                              |
| **Bond**            | Lists Nikkes whose bond level hasn't reached its limit-break maximum                                                                |

The Equipment, Skills, Dolls, and Bond views can be filtered by element or by a specific Solo Raid team.

### Verdict logic

- **Keep** — 2 or more good lines already at your target tier
- **Lock + Change Effects** — 1 good line; lock it and reroll the rest
- **Reset Attributes** — no good lines, or a good line that needs a tier upgrade
- Rock cost estimates factor in line appearance rates (Line 1: 100%, Line 2: 50%, Line 3: 30%) and tier probabilities

## Getting started

Open the app at https://pilgrimworks.github.io/Nikke-Manager

### Option 1 — Auto-import with the browser extension (recommended)

The **Nikke Manager** Chrome extension reads your gear data directly from [blablalink.com](https://www.blablalink.com) (which mirrors your in-game account) and imports everything into the app automatically — no manual data entry needed.

**Chrome Web Store:** [Nikke Manager Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nikke-manager/lkmibckbphaagkihbdmncaffedkkcmjp)  
**Extension repo:** [github.com/PilgrimWorks/Nikke-Manager-Extension](https://github.com/PilgrimWorks/Nikke-Manager-Extension)

**Requirements:**

- A [blablalink.com](https://www.blablalink.com) account linked to your NIKKE game
- Google Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser)

**Installation:**

Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nikke-manager/lkmibckbphaagkihbdmncaffedkkcmjp). The Nikke Manager icon will appear in your toolbar.

1. Log in to [blablalink.com](https://www.blablalink.com) in Chrome
2. Click the **Nikke Manager** icon in your toolbar
3. Click **Import Data** and wait around 10 seconds
4. The extension automatically opens the Nikke Manager and imports your data

If you are not logged in to blablalink, a login button will appear — click it, log in, then click **Import Data** again.

The extension popup also has a **Download Data** button to save your fetched data as a file — useful as a backup or for importing manually.

### Option 2 — Manual entry

1. Go to **Nikkes** and click **+ Add Nikke** to add the characters you're working on
